// JugglucoNG — Ottai driver
// OttaiParser.kt — BLE live/history payload framing + 12-byte record parser.
//
// Faithful to CgmMonitor.java (framing) + a1.a.e()/b()/c() (record parse,
// validity, AVERAGE rule) in the 1.1.0 watch decompile. See
// AGENTS/ottai-phase0-confirmed.md.
//
// Decrypted+trimmed payload layout:
//   bytes 0..3   status/prefix (unused by the parser)
//   bytes 4..5   frontDataNo (LE16)
//   bytes 6..7   marker/count (LE16; history continuation)
//   bytes 8..N   8- or 9-byte records (the E1.1 version string is ambiguous)
// Each BLE record becomes a 12-byte parser input:
//   {0x00,0x00} || LE16(frontDataNo + recordIndex) || record8
// 12-byte record fields:
//   [2..3] dataNo LE16
//   [4]    voltage
//   [5..7] runtime = (b5<<16) | (b7<<8) | b6        (mixed-endian, confirmed)
//   [8..9] raw current LE16
//   [10..11] temperature*100 LE16  -> /100.0
//
// Live mode parses only the LAST record; history parses all records.
//
// The record size is NOT re-guessed from content per payload once the driver has learned
// it. A minute live notify is header + one 9-byte record + padding, which is also a valid
// length for two 8-byte records, and one record is not enough content evidence to tell
// them apart. It IS re-derived every payload from the sensor's own frontDataNo advance,
// which a lone record can prove outright — see chooseRecordSize/decisiveRecordSize and
// frontDeltaRecordSize.

     * The version string is not a sufficient discriminator. A 2026-08-11 Syai and the
     * 2026-08-23 CN V3 sensor both report E1.1.4(V1.7.S2530.1), but the Syai puts 20
     * 8-byte records in a 168-byte frame while the CN V3 sensor advances 18 records per
     * 176-byte frame and uses the 9-byte field layout. Hard-coding E1.1 to 8 bytes therefore
     * decodes the V3 stream as temperatures over 500 °C and currents near zero.
     *
     * Only families whose layout has stayed unambiguous on hardware are trusted outright.
     * E1.1 is inferred from every payload. The inference uses the vendor's OWN validity gate
     * (raw current
     * >= 1000, temperature <= 45 — a1.a.b), not a made-up physiological band: a cold reading
     * is still valid, while the mis-aligned layout loses because it decodes an impossible
     * current/temperature (e.g. 505 °C).
     * 9-byte: current[0:2], temp[7:9]; 8-byte: current[4:6], temp[6:8].
     *
     * The inference is only as good as the payload it is given, and a minute live notify is
     * not good enough. It carries header(8) + one 9-byte record + seven pad bytes — 24 bytes,
     * which is equally a header plus two 8-byte records. One record cannot outvote two, and
     * the tie below falls to 8. A 2026-08-30 trace of an E1.1.4(V1.7.S2530.1) sensor caught
     * this happening on 112 of 702 live frames: each time, record[1] was assembled out of the
     * padding (`runtime=0 raw=0`), the live path's records.last() landed on it, it was
     * rejected, and the real sample in record[0] went unexamined. Fourteen consecutive
     * minutes were lost that way while the sensor was connected and talking.
     *
     * Two things can settle it ahead of that guess. [frontDeltaRecordSize] wins first: the
     * sensor's own dataNo advance from [previousFront] into this payload is ground truth,
     * proven fresh on every single frame — including the one-record frame above, which never
     * has enough content to prove anything on its own. Failing that, [learned] wins over the
     * guess: once [decisiveRecordSize] has settled the layout from a payload that could
     * actually settle it (a confirmed version, a frontDelta proof, or a lopsided vote on a
     * page with enough records), a short frame consumes that held answer rather than voting
     * again. The version string still outranks both — a confirmed family is not a guess at all.
